Table: Employee

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| department  | varchar |
| managerId   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of an employee, their department, and the id of their manager.
If managerId is null, then the employee does not have a manager.
No employee will be the manager of themself.
 

Write a solution to find managers with at least five direct reports.

Return the result table in any order.


-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below
WITH direct_reportees as(
SELECT managerid 
from employee 
group by managerid
having count(employee.id) >=5
)

SELECT name
from employee
INNER JOIN direct_reportees
ON employee.ID=direct_reportees.managerid;
